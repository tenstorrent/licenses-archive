# Licenses Archive

This repository is intended to be an archive of the various licenses for binary distributed content from Tenstorrent.  This is broken up by the various products that are shipping binaries and generally available.  If you need to find a historical version of something it should be contained in the git history for the object.  These licenses may include SPDX machine readable, as well as human readable files to help discern what is contained in the respective binary releases.
